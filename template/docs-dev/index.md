## Plugin internal documentation

The folder `docs-dev` is a place for internal documentation.

The files in here are committed to the Git repo, but excluded from the final plugin zip package.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone git@bitbucket.org:tangibleinc/<%= project.name %>.git
npm install && composer install
```
